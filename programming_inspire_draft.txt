- Came from a software development background
- Similar goals to product design: to develop a solution to a problem
- Nature of the product means different design approaches in some areas
- but many concepts are the same
 - Rapid prototyping easy
   - Jump forward
   - Is Dfx in some of my programs
   - e.g. in BlockLauncher, script to build, deploy, launch
   - easily iterate through designs
   - May not need to model, can build high-fidelity prototype easily, and prototype can be improved into product
    - e.g. Mercator: test by writing the program
   - Problems can be quickly spotted
    - e.g. transparency
   - Tried bringing this mentality to Praxis:
    - In the Conceptual design report, prototyping = difficult; took multiple hours to create rough prototype
    - Used Inkscape to draw the parts, and used rotation tool to find best way to rotate panes
   - In future, this could be possible

    - Rise of 3-D printing
 - There is a "Right" answer
   - Some software tasks have one right answer
    - e.g. look through the Android source looking for layers that software can draw to
   - Other tasks require thinking
    - e.g. how to structure program - which should be split up into Activities, for example, or how patching should be done
   - Similar to design
    - two types of arguments
    - Can find facts (one right answer, e.g. melting point) but also some that needs judgement (e.g. design so dishwasher safe)
     - Used both to select material for the ketchup bottle cap in the Detailed design report
 - Reference designs are available
   - When building PocketInvEditor, used existing software and modeled interface upon them
   - Looked at source of Android's built-in applications to see how they accomplished tasks
   - In Detailed Design Report, I used this approach
    - Looked at reference bottle caps by researching recyclable pop bottle caps
 - Worked alone
   - apps were mainly developed alone
   - In design, often work in teams
