title: Checking out the checklist
permalink: /eval/checklist.html

Today, during our Praxis lecture, the professor mentioned that checklists are super effective at reducing mistakes, verifying results, getting good grades, and solving world hunger. (OK, maybe not that last one), according to Gawande's book, [_The Checklist Manifesto_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000).

Well, not being a slacker, I decided to try out this checklist approach for my physics lab report, due tomorrow. I'll be writing my experiences with checklists as I write the report. Yes, we'll do it live! (No, I won't revise this draft, for the lolz)

First, I am going to identify the requirements that the lab report needs. Our lab instructor was kindly enough to send us an e-mail with various sections that need to be in the lab report. I decided to format it in list form.

 - Introduction explaining setup 1: a few paragraphs
 - Diagram explaining setup 1
 - Explain setup 2: a few paragraphs
 - Diagram explaining setup 2
 - Answer question 1
 - Answer question 2
 - Answer question 3
 - Answer question 4, 5
 - Answer question 6, 7, 8, 9
 - For part one, the difference in the moment of inertia before and after cylindrical weight added to the moment of inertia of the weight. 
 - Error propagation for part 1
 - Answer are numbers compatible
 - For part two, compare the angular momentum before and after the "collision"
 - Answer: Is angular momentum conserved (to within your error margins?)
 - Error propagation for part 2
 - Discussion of errors
 - Discussion of further errors
 - Conclusion: state main results
 - Conclusion: state limitations
 - Conclusion: possible setup improvements

All that in one checklist - and I haven't even looked at the ideas for improvements from the comments given to my previous reports!

Reviewing the previous reports, I came up with these tasks:
 - Label the diagram explaining setup 1
 - Label the diagram explaining setup 2
 - Specific measurements for materials section
 - Have procedure section
 - No results in procedure/introduction section
 - Have Results section
 - Have explanation (caption/paragraph) on all graphs
 - Data tables have correct sigfigs
 - Labels for table columns - variables need contextual explanation
 - All equations done with equation editor
 - Graph axis are labeled
 - All measurements have space between units, e.g. 10 kg

Armed with my checklist, I'm ready to begin my lab report now. Wish me luck :)
