In CIV102, our group was tasked with building a truss bridge across a 150-metre valley. During the project, I produced the design drawing, and helped with some of the calculations.

Our group explained the rationale of our design decisions in our [design report](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-fqnmBSesbtOTRYd0FVQWhKSDQ/edit).
