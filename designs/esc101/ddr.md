In the Detailed Design Project phase of our engineering design course, we each played the role of a subcontractor, working out the details of one subcomponent in a design concept.

I was assigned the task of finding a suitable material for a ketchup bottle lid. I started by identifying constraints and metrics that would enable me to evaluate the solutions. Then. following [my design process](../../process.html), I searched for reference designs, specifically, the plastics used on pop bottles. I augmented this research by looking at the properties of various plastics in two handbooks on plastic food packaging. Finally, I evaluated each candidate plastic according to the metrics, and selected the one which I believed offered the best combination of characteristics.
