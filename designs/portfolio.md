The site you are looking at.

Time: September 2013 - Current

Medium: Web

Source code: https://github.com/zhuowei/design

## Goals
- Started with three goals:
 - contains similar material as other sites
 - simple layout
 - made from scratch (not w/Google Sites, Tumblr, etc) for learning

## Tools used
 - GitHub Pages - simple web hosting
 - Jekyll - web page template engine, included by GitHub pages
 - HTML/CSS - design web pages

## Process
 - Referred to goal 1:
  - a navigation area, a title, and content area
  - needs design statement, design process, past design work pages
 - Simple layout: sans-serif font, solid background colors
 - Started with sidebar design - inspiration from Windows Metro style
  - [prototype](portfolio/oldindex.html)
  - too difficult for beginner in CSS - so step back, reconsider
  - use design to aid engineering
 - Revised to move navigation to top
  - much easier to create
  - wastes less space since bar scrolls away - see economy
  - reviewed existing pages using this navigation method
   - Android developer help pages use this layout, so examined it to see how they did it
  - Finally, used trial-and-error and documentation (learning model?) to figure out top nav bar
  - kept code simple - easy to learn for me, and page loads faster
 - finally, write content
  - first, point form to test layout and to get rough sense of what to write
  - will clean up and rewrite using these points later
  - will continue to evolve as my design abilities and beliefs change
