title: Praxis II Concept Design - Inclined Curve and Procedure

- approach: look at each part of the unloading process separately, choosing solutions that would solve bottlenecks in each stage and that can work with other chosen solutions
- solutions should be able to stand on their own in case Scott Mission does not implement full solution
- solutions should take advantage of off-the-shelf components - practicality
- identified stages from RFP description
1. truck drives and parks to line up with door
2. One person gets into the truck, sets up ramp to go down chute
3. Person repeatedly lift item to ramp, taking care not to spill items
4. Chef chooses item that he/she takes
5. Items that are not chosen go down the ramp

So for each part, scope down

 - think of alternate solutions
 - Research reference designs for candidate solutions
 - Attempted to use as much off-the-shelf materials as possible

End design: four solutions that can be implemented separately or as a whole

1. Curved conveyor belt to allow the truck to simply back into the alleyway instead of having to maneuver in the tight parking lot to line up with the door
2. A new lifting procedure that splits the work evenly between 3 workers in the truck
3. A gate to identify large packages before they are able to jam the intake window
4. Anti-slip tape for the interiour conveyor belt to prevent slipping and tumbling of boxes
