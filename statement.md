I consider design and engineering as two facets of one concept: to make decisions that help achieve a goal. 

- goal: to solve a problem and satisfy people/users/viewers
- Design: what the user sees 
- Engineering: what the user doesn't immediately perceive
- Both have common criteria
 - economy: nothing extra, everything has a purpose in the finished product
 - elegance: aethestically pleasing
 - safety: protection
 - resiliance: long-lasting
 - time-to-market: rapid development of solutions
